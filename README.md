This project is a casting agency to operate movies and actors. 
All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). 

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development 
Developers using this project should already have Python3, pip and node installed on their local machines.

#### Backend

To run the application run the following commands: 
```
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
or (Windows 10 PowerShell):
```
$env:FLASK_APP='flaskr'
$env:FLASK_ENV='development'
flask run
```

The application is run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration. 

#### Frontend

From the frontend folder, run the following commands to start the client: 
```
npm install // only once to install dependencies
npm start 
```

By default, the frontend will run on localhost:3000. 

### Tests
In order to run tests navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands: 

```
python test_flaskr.py
```

All tests are kept in that file and should be maintained as updates are made to app functionality.
