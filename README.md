## :page_with_curl: About

The Casting Agency models is a company responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies.

This project is part of Udacity [Full Stack Web Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044) Nanodegree Program.

#### Motivation
Develop a powerful modern web application doing:
1. Design and build databases for software application,
2. Create and deploy database-backed web app, and
3. Secure and manage user authentication and access control.

#### RBAC  

The application has CRUD methods performed within two entities, actors and movies. In order to perform these operations, there are three roles:
1. Casting Assistant
2. Casting Director
3. Executive Producer

Each role has different permissions, going from retrieving actors/movies information to update and delete them.
